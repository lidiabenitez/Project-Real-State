Real State - Barcelona
Where can you live in Barcelona for less than 700 euros per month? In this project I am going to analyze the evolution that the city has experienced in recent years, focusing on rent, the value of houses and the demographic profile of the inhabitants. I have created this project to reflect with data the gentrification movement that is taking place in Spain and that is causing people to have to leave their homes so that they can be used for tourism at a higher price. It seems that this problem is also moving to my city, Malaga, so I have decided to study the problem from the origin to be prepared and create an action plan from the citizen's conscience.

This project stands out because it affects the living conditions of many Spaniards and because it helps us understand what is happening in our country (especially in the most touristic cities) so as not to live in ignorance

I think that it is a situation with many controversies because, on the one hand, tourism is the main economic pillar of Spain, but on the other hand, if the situation continues to worsen, as the evolution in my results shows, it can cause serious problems for citizens, taking into account He realizes that the labor and economic situation is not good at the moment. So both sides should not be forgotten.

I have learned that despite my initial expectations, since I have been hearing about the situation in Barcelona for years, the data shows that the situation is returning to normal
